# Welcome to my Github - I'm a ML/AI developer and scientist named Shantanu
There are all types of projects on here, mainly things related to machine learning, artificial intellegence, or projects that I was working on that I thought were cool... I am forever intellectually curious and constantly pick up new things. I primarly spend my time working on ML/AI Projects, with some software development on teh side. <br>
### About Me
I primarly consider myself a junior ML engineer, but as a student, I take oppurtunities and make the most out of them. I do full-stack development, as well as software development. I program in `C++`, `JavaScript`, `Python`.
### A key to my repository
- `LM` indicates a learning module -  a course or class I took that taught me some skills associated with a language or development tool
- `T` indicates a teaching module - something I used as a project as a teaching aid or to explain a concept
-  All other repositories have individual projects with in them
-  `NC` indicates an engineering project that does not only involve code, but rather hardware as well
### Some things to check out
- the [Certifications Repo](https://github.com/ShantanuJhaveri/Generative-Designs) has a list of certifications that I completed during my time so far
- the [LM-intro_ML Repo](https://github.com/ShantanuJhaveri/LM-Intro_ML) is where I try to link everything that I have been learning at USC as it relates to ML/AI development. Becuase of some course requirements though, I was not able to put all of my course work or projects
- the [Generative Design Repo](https://github.com/ShantanuJhaveri/certifications) is where I keep generative designs and math-art projects as they relate to code. 
- I program in C++ and

###### as you can tell, I spent a lot of my time learning, building a diverse skill set and making sure I know the ins and outs of everything that I work with. Now I would like to take my development to the next level, contact me with project and collaboration inquiries sj06434@usc.edu
